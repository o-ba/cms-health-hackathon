## Project Definition and Goals

In the realm of application hosting, uptime monitoring has always been the traditional approach to safeguard websites and e-commerce stores. While this is indeed efficient and straightforward, the increasing complexity of modern applications makes this method inadequate in professional settings.

To address this flaw in modern application operation, our focus extends beyond mere uptime monitoring to encompass the true vital aspects of an online application, such as updates, user management, shop orders, and other crucial health metrics. The lack of functionality in parts of an application can often go unnoticed with standard monitoring practices.

The project aims to collect, analyze, and provide additional data from websites with a better understanding of their health to the respective operator. The website operator or hosting company is often expected to keep the overview, but the absence of a standardized format for health checks across the manifold CMS landscape makes this a hard challenge to solve.

Based on this idea, a first Proof of Concept was created at Cloudfest Hackathon 2024 with the goal to jointly develop a health check format that works for open-source systems like Drupal, Typo3, Joomla!, WordPress, and frameworks. The initial phase involves the ideation and development of a standardized format for the CMS health checks, that accommodates the unique requirements of different open-source systems and offers flexibility and extensibility. Additionally, weâ€™re aiming to have the first basic implementation for the participating CMS systems in place that can report basic health data in a secure and privacy-friendly way.

## Format

The interface is based on HTTP communication with responses in JSON format. The format is based on the IETF draft "Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs" (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-inadarei-api-health-check-06). Please see the following example and explanation:
